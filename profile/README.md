# SherlockMC
## SherlockMC is a development group working on a self-titled project called SherlockMC, which is a Minecraft server scanner that utilizes a frontend Discord Bot.
The project was created to find specific Minecraft accounts on servers, as there is no official Mojang API for this purpose. The project is written entirely in Nodejs.

# What is SherlockMC?
SherlockMC is a Minecraft server scanner that allows users to search for specific Minecraft accounts on servers. The scanner is able to search through the server's player list and find the account that the user is looking for. The scanner is designed to be fast and efficient, allowing users to quickly find the account they need.

The frontend Discord Bot is used to interact with the scanner. Users can input commands into the bot, such as the name of the account they are looking for, and the bot will run the scanner to find the account. The bot also provides information about the scanner, such as how to use it and what commands are available.
